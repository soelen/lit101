# Frontend collab

## Why?

- To have a visual example how frontend related components work
- To demonstrate how to build, distribute and make webcomponents work in different Frameworks.

## Installation and start

- Install all dependencies with `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` in main package.

## How to distribute all webcomponents

- Run `npm build:lit`. All framework should now have the newest version of all distributes webcomponents.

## Things to consider

- Checkout [custom-elements-everywhere.com](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com) to see and understand in which framework webcomponent can work. As you can see the support for react is not good. The team behind lit also provides with [@lit-labs/react](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/react) a react component wrapper to make webcomponents work perfectly in react based apps. An example is provided in this project.

## TODO

- Provide reset css
